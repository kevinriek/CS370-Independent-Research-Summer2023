# Summer 2023 Indepdendent Undergraduate Research (CS 370)

This is the repository for my Summer CS 370 Independent research project, under the supervision of Dr. Risto Miikkulainen.
In short, in this project I used the NEAT algorithm (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to train a neural network
to play a simple strategy video game.
The research jounral for this project can be found in the repository, under Jounral/CS370_Journal.docx.
